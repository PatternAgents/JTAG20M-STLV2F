PatternAgents uses the increasingly popular business model called "Dual Licensing" 
in which both the open source software distribution mechanism and traditional commercial software distribution models are combined.

Open Source Projects:        

If you are developing and distributing open source applications under the Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, 
as published by the Creative Commons Foundation, then you are free to use the PatternAgents hardware/software under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. 
Please note that CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 requires that all modifications to the original code as well as all Derivative Works 
must also be released under the terms of the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

Closed Source Projects:

If you are developing and distributing traditional closed source or commercial applications, 
you must purchase a PatternAgents commercial use license, 
which is specifically designed for users interested in retaining the proprietary status of their designs and code. 
All PatternAgents commercial licenses expressly supersede the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. 
This means that when you license the PatternAgents software under a commercial license, 
you specifically do not use the software under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and therefore you are not subject to any of its terms.
